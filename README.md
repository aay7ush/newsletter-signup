## Features

- Simple and intuitive newsletter sign-up form.
- Success message displayed upon successful form submission.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Email Validation

The email input in the form is validated to ensure that a properly formatted email address is entered. The validation is done using a regular expression pattern. The pattern used in this project checks for the basic structure of an email address but does not cover all possible edge cases. For more comprehensive email validation, additional techniques or libraries can be used.
